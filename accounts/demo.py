"""
Demo mode: "Try the demo" creates a throwaway user filled with sample data.

Every visitor gets their own demo user, so nothing they do is seen by anyone
else, and the normal per-user scoping keeps demo data and real data apart
exactly as it keeps two real users apart. Demo users are deleted when they sign
out, and any left over are deleted by the daily job after DEMO_LIFETIME.
